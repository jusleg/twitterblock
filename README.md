Block fake twitter followers

## How does it work?

Twitter Block is using a script built by [Clayton Lambert](https://claytonn.com/). When the script is called, it looks for every followers' picture, banner, description and link. Every follower gets a score according to those criterias. If the score is above a certain treshold, the follower will be blocked. This script was packaged into a chrome extension for ease of use.

## What types of accounts will it block?

Here are the criterias to determine if an account is fake. A combination of those criterias will flag an account as fake.

- Accounts with an egg avatar,
- Accounts with a description length below 15 characters
- Accounts without a profile banner
- Accounts with a russian link

## How to install the extension
